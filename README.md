Paige is a furry discord bot written in Python who’ll brighten you up after you’ve been sitting in a dark room for an hour thinking of the meaning of the universe. She can:

Tell the time in UTC
Calculate numbers
Generate nonsensical sentences
Generate numbers
Translate your text into owo language
Give basic opinions
Have basic conversations with commands
Dispense (furry) memes, as well as other pictures
Roast you
Make server rules
Get very exited about holidays
Give you bubblewrap made out of spoilers (type .bubblewrap_supreme if you wanna get crazy with the 10x10 bubblewrap sheet in an embed)
Kick someone on command
Plus Much more stuff!
Paige is primarily SFW but does have a few NSFW commands as well. Type .paigecommands for the regular commands list, and .help for help on all the lists. While most commands are on the commands lists, Paige also has some commands that aren’t on any lists. These “secret commands” are meant to be discovered by you. Paige is also not a huge huge bot, but a lot of care was put into her code, and she can do some pretty unique things. She has no shortage of commands though- more than 130! And, as time goes on, more will be added. Don’t worry, all commands lists are updated accordingly.

The ultimate goal was to make Paige a friendly, “relatable” bot that anyone can use and talk to. She has quirks and unusual things you don’t usually see with discord bots. For instance, when’s the last time you saw a bot with the status “Listening to 4Vögel - 3.75 Billion Pieces of Toast 🔭️”?

Paige’s main command prefix is ., but you can also type pge, Hey Paige,, or just Paige,.
